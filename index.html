<h1>~IT'S OK!~</h1>
<hr />

My name is Elodie. I have been working on this small buisness for about two months. I am very exited for the future of this small business, and very proud of myself. Of course, I couldn't do this if it wasen't for my brother, Robel. He has helped me learn and master the technique to coding and computer science. Thanks to him, now i know what i want to be when i grow up. A software engineer! Thank you family for supporting me through this journey. Love you all!
